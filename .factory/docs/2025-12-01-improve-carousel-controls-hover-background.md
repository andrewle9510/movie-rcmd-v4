I'll update the hoverBackgroundColor in movie-detail-ui-config.ts to provide better visual feedback with more contrast and a livelier feel. Currently, it uses "bg-white/40" which is semi-transparent white. 

I'll change it to use a more vibrant color that aligns with the project's color scheme (based on the CSS variables defined in globals.css). The project uses Letterboxd-inspired colors with primary green (#00e054) and secondary blue (#40bcf4). 

For the hover effect, I'll use "bg-secondary/70" which would be the action blue with 70% opacity, providing:
1. Better visual contrast with the default background
2. A more lively feel with the vibrant blue color
3. Consistency with the project's color scheme
4. Good visibility against different backdrop images

This will make the carousel controls more noticeable and responsive when users hover over them.
